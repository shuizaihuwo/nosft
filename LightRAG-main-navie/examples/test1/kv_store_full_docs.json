An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \"\"require all denied\"\", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.

A Velocity template can be provided through Velocity templates in a configset `velocity/` directory or as a parameter. A user defined configset could contain renderable, potentially malicious, templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled` by defining a response writer with that setting set to `true`. Defining a response writer requires configuration API access. Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely, and only enables the configset-provided template rendering when the configset is `trusted` (has been uploaded by an authenticated user).\",Apply updates per vendor instructions.,2022-05-03,,1,2019-12-30,7.5,CWE-74,NETWORK,HIGH,HIGH"
